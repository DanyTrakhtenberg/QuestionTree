# QuestionTree
A player chooses answers to questions and advances to more questions. Done with Angular and .NET core. every question is an Angular component that receives an interface of a question, answer and a list of follow up question interfaces. That way, when a user selects an answer the fallow up question list will be presented next to the user.
The choses of the user are saved by highlighting the button. The buttons are disabled so the user cannot change the answers.
To answer the questions again, refresh the page
